# AlphaFarkle

Inspired by [AlphaGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo), this project seeks to train an AI to play the dice game, 
[Farkle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farkle).  Much like [AlphaGo Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_Zero), 
AlphaFarkle is designed to learn to effectively play the game of Farkle by exclusively playing against itself.

## Design 

Because Farkle is a folk game, the rules are not well standardized.  AlphaFarkle is trained using the
[rules defined by Elverson Puzzle](https://www.elversonpuzzle.com/Farkle-instructions11.pdf).
